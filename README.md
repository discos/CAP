# CAP
Cross-scan Analysis Pipeline

CAP is a collection of IDL-programming-language ((c)Exelis) procedures. 

It requires IDL 8.x and the "IDL astrolib" libraries, downloadable from 
https://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/homepage.html  

Copy all the procedures in a folder inside your IDL workspace, in a folder
under the "Default" path. 

Full descriptions of all procedures are available in the wiki page:
